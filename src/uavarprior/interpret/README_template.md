# Variant Analysis Results

This directory contains the results of running the variant analysis module on genetic variant data.

## Files Description

For each prediction model (`pred1`, `pred150`) and group number, the following files are generated:

- `cell_specific_variants_<model>_group_<n>.pkl`: Pickle file containing cell-specific variant names (appearing in exactly 1 file)
- `cell_specific_variants_<model>_group_<n>.txt`: Text file with the same variant names, one per line
- `cell_nonspecific_variants_<model>_group_<n>.pkl`: Pickle file containing cell-nonspecific variant names (appearing in at least 80 files)
- `cell_nonspecific_variants_<model>_group_<n>.txt`: Text file with the same variant names, one per line

Additional files that may be present:
- `unique_names_group_<n>.pkl`: All unique variant names for a given group
- `variant_membership_matrix_group_<n>.pkl`: Matrix showing which variants appear in which files

## How to Load These Results

You can load these results in Python using:

```python
import pickle

with open('cell_specific_variants_pred1_group_1.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    cell_specific_variants = pickle.load(f)

with open('cell_nonspecific_variants_pred1_group_1.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    cell_nonspecific_variants = pickle.load(f)
```
