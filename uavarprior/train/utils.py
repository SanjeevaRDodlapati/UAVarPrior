    Loads model weights that were saved to a file previously by `torch.save`.
    This is a helper function to reconcile state dict keys where a model was
    saved with/without torch.nn.DataParallel and now must be loaded
    without/with torch.nn.DataParallel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_dict : collections.OrderedDict
        The state of the model.
    model : torch.nn.Module
        The PyTorch model, a module composed of submodules.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.nn.Module \
        The model with weights loaded from the state dict.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If model state dict keys do not match the keys in `state_dict`.
